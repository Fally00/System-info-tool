# SIT — System Insight Toolkit

**SIT** is a lightweight, cross-platform **System Information Toolkit** written in C++.
It provides essential system details and real-time usage metrics with a clean and minimal design.

The goal of SIT is to offer **clear visibility into system state** without unnecessary complexity,
making it useful for learning, diagnostics, and future system monitoring extensions.

## Features

![System Start Menu](assest/sit1.2.png)

### System Information
- Operating System name
- CPU model
- Total RAM size
- Total disk capacity
- System uptime
- Current user information

### System Usage
- CPU usage percentage
- RAM usage percentage
- DISK usage percentage

### System Health Score
- CPU health score based on its usage
- RAM health score based on its usage
- DISK health score based on its usage
- Overall health score

### Problem Scanner
- High CPU or RAM usage detection
- Long uptime detection
- Overheating detection (when sensors are available)

### File Integrity Checker
- Project-local integrity manifest
- SHA-256 hashing for change detection
- Flags changed, missing, or new files
- Manifest file: `.sit_integrity.manifest` in the chosen root path

```
Usage

- integrity init [path] creates a project-local manifest file at .sit_integrity.manifest in the chosen root (default is the current directory).
- integrity check [path] compares current files to the manifest and reports OK/Changed/Missing/New/Errors.
- integrity update [path] recreates the manifest when you intentionally changed files and want a new baseline.

```

### CLI 
- Active cli commands
- Help & Version commands added
- System usage commands
- System info commands
- System health commands
- System scan commands
- System integrity commands
- System all for listing all system info , usage & health score 

All usage values are calculated using **native OS APIs**, not estimates.

---

## Usage

SIT supports both command-line and interactive modes.

### Command-Line Mode

```bash
./sysinfo [command]
```

#### Commands
- `info`     - Show basic system information
- `usage`    - Show system resource usage
- `health`   - Show system health status
- `scan`     - Scan for common system problems
- `all`      - Show all information
- `integrity`- Manage file integrity manifest (init/check/update)

#### Options
- `--help`, `-h`    - Show help message
- `--version`, `-v` - Show version information

#### Examples
```bash
./sysinfo --help
./sysinfo info
./sysinfo usage
./sysinfo health
./sysinfo scan
./sysinfo integrity init
./sysinfo integrity check
./sysinfo integrity update
./sysinfo all
```

### Interactive Mode

If no arguments are provided, SIT starts in interactive shell mode.

```bash
./sysinfo
```

You will see a prompt `sysinfo> ` where you can type commands like `info`, `usage`, `health`, `scan`, `integrity`, `all`, `help`, `version`, or `exit` to quit.

Example session:
```
sysinfo> help
System Information Tool Commands

Commands:
  info     Show basic system information
  usage    Show system resource usage
  health   Show system health status
  scan     Scan for common system problems
  integrity init|check|update [path]  File integrity tools
  all      Show all information
  help     Show this help message
  version  Show version information
  exit     Exit the tool

sysinfo> info
---------- System Basic Info ----------
...
sysinfo> exit
Exiting System Information Tool.
```

## Planned Features

The following features are planned and currently under development:

- [x] System problems scanner (errors / weaknesses indicators)
- [x] File integrity checker
- [ ] Part of a new major project soon !

These additions are designed to keep SIT **lightweight, transparent, and safe**.

---

## Supported Platforms

- **Windows** (via WinAPI)
- **Linux** (via `/proc` and standard system files)

The codebase uses conditional compilation to keep platform-specific logic isolated.

---

## Design Philosophy

- Minimal dependencies
- Native OS APIs only
- Clear and readable C++ code
- No background services or invasive system access
- Easy to extend without refactoring the core

SIT is intentionally built as a **toolkit**.

---

## Build Instructions

### Requirements
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Windows: MinGW / MSVC  
- Linux: GCC or Clang  

### Build (example)
```bash
g++ -o sysinfo main.cpp cli.cpp systemInfo.cpp health.cpp integrity.cpp -std=c++17

OR

.\sysinfo (in vs code terminal)
